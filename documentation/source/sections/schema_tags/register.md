# !Register
The `!Register` tag is used within the order section of a [!Config](./config.md) tag to specify the position that a normal register [!Group](./group.md) should be instantiated.

Each normal register [!Group](./group.md) can only be used once, and is instantiated with the same name as the group. This is unlike macro type [!Groups](./group.md) which can be instantiated multiple times with different names.

## Usage

```eval_rst
.. automodule:: blade.schema.ph_register
    :members:
    :special-members:
```
