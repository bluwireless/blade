# !Const

The `!Const` tag is used to tie a port of a module to a constant value, rather than connecting it to another module. For more information on describing interconnectivity, see the [!Connect](./connect.md) and [!Mod](./mod.md) tag descriptions.

```eval_rst
.. note::
    In the future `!Def` and `!Const` tags may be merged into one new tag in order to reduce complexity of the schema.
```

## Usage

```eval_rst
.. automodule:: blade.schema.ph_const
    :members:
    :special-members:
```
